# model
This is the code for the paper "From opinion to identity dynamics". Written in Mathematica.

1: "identity-model_NHB-simulation-code.nb"
Contains the code and all modules for simulation of the model

2: "identity-model_NHB-simulation-display.nb"
Calls the module "simulation" and dynamically displays the average strengths. (Optionally one may also display a sample of local strengths from the system, but that slows down the speed significantly if done dynamically.)

3: "identity-model_NHB-figure-2.nb"
Contains the simulation results (data) used for Figure 2. (Directly obtained from  "identity-model_NHB-simulation-display.nb")

4: "identity-model_NHB-figure-3.nb"
Contains the simulation results (data) used for Figure 3. The code generating the data, calling the ordinary "simulation" module is also included.

5: "identity-model_NHB-figure-4.nb"
Contains the simulation results (data) used for Figure 4. The code generating the data, calling the ordinary "simulation" module is also included.
